# Electify
A blockchain based website to conduct secure and reliable elections.
## Background
Many voters are unaware of all the candidates fighting in their city or town or sometimes people end up giving vote to people based on their popularity only regardless of their previous works and claim. By this project I meant to tackle this problem.
## Concept
All the candidates contesting in a region can upload their portfolios containing all the claims they will perform after they are elected. All this data will be stored on the blockchain. So for current year the data of the previous elections will be used to show what are the claims proposed earlier were actually completed. Also legit people from different places can endorse their claims. The website will help voters vote for candidates based on facts and not baseless claims.
## Other Problems 
1. Every voter will be allowed to claim only once for every candidate. Aadhar card with a face recognition ( or a fingerprint scanner ) will be used to verify the identity of the voter.
2. Identity of the voters will be kept hidden when endorse any claims.
3. To prevent hacking of database, decentralized ledger will be used.

## Other Benefits

 1. Now political leaders will also be able to choose candidates for the elections based on their popularity and the claims they fulfilled.
 2. All the candidates data of the previous elections will be made stored in blockchain which can be used for further studies and research.

## Future Expansion 
If the time permits then this website will also be modified to be used to vote candidates in elections. Since voting process is a one-day activity so this will be made a time bound process. 

## Tools Used

 1. Microsoft Azure Blockchain
 2. Bootstrap, JavaScript for the frontend of the website
 3. Other Tools based on their needs
